Welcome to the beginning of an era - my brand new DevOps/technology blog! I've been playing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a ruby-based static website generator that is integrated into GitHub) and it got me thinking... Thanks to the Windows Subsystem for Linux, it was very easy for me to run Jekyll locally (something I failed to do in the past with native Windows binaries). Once I got it all up and running, I figured why not start a DevOps/Tech blog?! After a bit of tweaking, here goes!

I primarily work with Windows - so before you judge, I promise you that Windows 10 is a solid and extremely capable OS, if you know what you're doing. I was never a fan of OSX/MacOS (although I've used Macs exclusively in my [Fairfield Mirror](http://fairfieldmirror.com/news/mirror-named-one-of-the-best-online-newspapers-in-country/) web development days). I really respect Apple hardware - MacBooks are without a doubt the best laptop hardware that exists, period. However, I am most comfortable with the Windows OS, and Microsoft has come a long way from the old days of Windows XP and Windows 7. (Let's just pretend the disaster of Windows 8 didn't happen, and it started improving by 8.1)&hellip; Microsoft should be commended for embracing the open source community, and has come a very long way since its earlier days.

Anyway, enough rambling. Some of the topics I'll be discussing are CI/CD best practices, open source software, .NET (including core), Azure, Android, IoT devices, life hacks and scripting (most likely in PowerShell). My goal is to highlight CI/CD best practices, and tips and tricks that make my life easier. Hopefully you can learn a thing or two!

Stay tuned and I'll try to post some cool things! Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter: [@jcefoli](https://twitter.com/jcefoli)
