## About Me
Hi! My name is Joe Cefoli, and I am a technology enthusiast born and raised in the suburbs of New York City and recently relocated to Columbus, Ohio. I am passionate about nature, bike rides, renewable energy, space and science! In my spare time, you can find me spending time outdoors with my beautiful wife, my amazing lab mix Luna, and cooking with friends and family.

Ever since I was in middle school, I developed a deep interest in all aspects of technology and spent lots of time fixing my family and friends’ computers, tinkering with scripts, and filing bug reports for open source software. It was destined that I would put all of these skills to good use to make my personal life easier and advance my career.

I am constantly learning about new technologies and love a challenge!

### Career
I’ve accumulated over 7 years of experience scaling and automating multitenant web based software and developed extensive experience working directly with customers, quality assurance, release engineering, and system operations. I am currently a DevOps engineer for [Booker Software]( https://www.booker.com/company), and am the glue between its software development team and system operations team. I automate things so we don’t waste time doing repetitive, manual tasks. Additionally, we are continually tweaking our [CI/CD]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) so our development and QA teams can spend more time coding, testing and less time worrying about the details behind how it gets deployed. 

It is very important to eat your own dogfood, try to break things before others find it and utilize your own product by putting yourself in your customers' shoes.
